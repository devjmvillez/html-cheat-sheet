    <h1>HTML Tags Cheat Sheet (h1)</h1>
    <p>I am a paragraph (p) that reminds you that the h1 is the biggest one and it is best to only have one h1 tag on your page.</p>
    <h2>Headings (h2)</h2>
    <p>Another p tag that wants to tell you how the h2 is smaller than h1 and it gets even smaller the more you go up (h1 - h6)</p>
    <h3>This is an h3</h3>
    <p>In case you forgot, what's above me is an h3 element, and I am a p element or a paragraph</p>
    <h4>I'm an h4 and i am this big</h4>
    <p>Remember, this p element wants you to know that it is not good to use heading elements such as the h4 above me to resize text. It is best to use CSS font-size property.</p>
    <h5>This is an h5. I can go up one more level and I get even smaller</h5>
    <p>We will learn about CSS later. Don't worry it's fun!</p>
    <h6>I am the last one. My name is h6</h6>
    <p>You got this! Don't give up! -p element</p>

    <h2>Now we will talk about lists</h2>
    <h3>Unordered Lists</h3>
    <p>I am marked with bullet points and I go inside the ul tags</p>
    <h4>Here is a sample list:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>list item one (li tag)</li>
        <li>list item two (li tag)</li>
        <li>im the third item but we are not in order thats why there is no numbering</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>This is a sample ordered list called Polya's Problem Solving Framework:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Understand the problem</li>
        <li>Come up with a plan</li>
        <li>Carry out the plan</li>
        <li>Go back and improve your solution</li>
    </ol>
