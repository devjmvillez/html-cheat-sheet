    <h1 id="back-to-top">HTML Tags Cheat Sheet (h1)</h1>
    <p>I am a paragraph (p) that reminds you that the h1 is the biggest one and it is best to only have one h1 tag on
        your page.</p>
    <h2>Headings (h2)</h2>
    <p>Another p tag that wants to tell you how the h2 is smaller than h1 and it gets even smaller the more you go up
        (h1 - h6)</p>
    <h3>This is an h3</h3>
    <p>In case you forgot, what's above me is an h3 element, and I am a p element or a paragraph</p>
    <h4>I'm an h4 and i am this big</h4>
    <p>Remember, this p element wants you to know that it is not good to use heading elements such as the h4 above me to
        resize text. It is best to use CSS font-size property.</p>
    <h5>This is an h5. I can go up one more level and I get even smaller</h5>
    <p>We will learn about CSS later. Don't worry it's fun!</p>
    <h6>I am the last one. My name is h6</h6>
    <p>You got this! Don't give up! -p element</p>

    <h2>Now we will talk about lists</h2>
    <h3>Unordered Lists</h3>
    <p>I am marked with bullet points and I go inside the ul tags</p>
    <h4>Here is a sample list:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>list item one (li tag)</li>
        <li>list item two (li tag)</li>
        <li>im the third item but we are not in order thats why there is no numbering</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>This is a sample ordered list called Polya's Problem Solving Framework:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Understand the problem</li>
        <li>Come up with a plan</li>
        <li>Carry out the plan</li>
        <li>Go back and improve your solution</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Anchors (aka links)</h2>
    <p>Anchor or a tags create links to other pages or a section of the page. The url goes inside the "href" attribute.
        Go to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">Duck Duck Go</a> to search more information.</p>

    <p>Setting `target=_blank"` will open the link in a new window. Try <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a" target="_blank">this link</a> to see what
        I mean!</p>

    <p>Like I said, you can use anchors to jump to a section of the page. Click this <a href="#back-to-top">back to
            top</a> link to go back to the top of the page.</p>

    <!-- I need to do em and strong next -->

    <h2>Text Emphasis</h2>
    <h2>Italic</h2>
    <p><em>This is an italicized text for emphasis. I used the em tag.</em></p>
    <h2>Bold</h2>
    <p><strong>This is some bolded text. You can use the strong tag for it.</strong></p>

    <h2>Organizing Content using div and span</h2>
    <h3>div</h3>
    <p>The `div` element is a block element, so each div will appear on a new line.</p>
    <div>First div</div>
    <div>Second div</div>
    <div>Third div</div>

    <h3>Span</h3>
    <h2>The span element is an inline element. It means there will be no line break between each `span`.</h2>
    <span>First span</span>
    <span>Second span</span>
    <span>Third span</span>

    <h2>You can use `br` to put a line break in between.</h2>
    <p>I will put a br tag after this period.<br>
        Now it starts on a new line. I will put another one after this period. <br>
        Here I start on another line. Awesome right?
    </p>
